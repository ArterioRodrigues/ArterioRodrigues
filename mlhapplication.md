**MLH APPLICATION ANSWERS**

My name is Arterio Rodrigues, and I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the Summer 2023 class. I have always been
excited by new challenges and love learning new things, which led me to pursue Computer Science in 2019. Although I hadn’t 
coded much before then, I developed a passion for the field over my four years at Hunter College. I dedicated time outside of
school to build projects on GitHub, solve hundreds of LeetCode problems, and construct computers from 6502 processors and x86 
architectures.

Currently, I am delving into electrical engineering with guidance from my sister and dad, which has opened new avenues of 
discovery for me. I recently bought an Arduino and various components like resistors, motors, and servos to learn about
integrating programming and robotics. My goal is to build a model submarine, airplane, and rocket, and eventually, a 
satellite. To achieve this, I have been studying books, watching YouTube tutorials, and practicing diligently. I'm currently 
focused on learning about radio waves and transmitters, and I am not slowing down.


I mention all this to illustrate my curiosity and passion for learning new topics and taking on increasingly challenging 
projects. Besides these personal projects, my major goal right now is securing a job in the tech field, which has proven to be 
one of the biggest challenges I have faced. Since graduating, I have applied to 3-5 jobs daily and secured only five 
interviews without any offers. I believe a key reason for this is my lack of internship experience during college, primarily 
due to the impact of COVID-19.


Despite this, I am confident in my skills and eager to learn whatever is necessary to get the job done. This determination led
me to pursue a master’s degree, hoping to gain internship opportunities. I could have settled for a job outside of tech, but 
my love for the field drives me to take this gamble, hoping it pays off. Becoming an MLH Fellow is a crucial part of this 
journey, providing me with the experience and skill development I need to succeed in the tech industry.
