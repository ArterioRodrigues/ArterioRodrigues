**MLH APPLICATION ANSWERS**

My name is Arterio Rodrigues, and I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the Summer 2023 class. I have always been
excited by new challenges and love learning new things, which led me to pursue Computer Science in 2019. Although I hadn’t 
coded much before then, I developed a passion for the field over my four years at Hunter College. I dedicated time outside of
school to build projects on GitHub, solve hundreds of LeetCode problems, and construct computers from 6502 processors and x86 
architectures.

Currently, I am delving into electrical engineering with guidance from my sister and dad, which has opened new avenues of 
discovery for me. I recently bought an Arduino and various components like resistors, motors, and servos to learn about
integrating programming and robotics. My goal is to build a model submarine, airplane, and rocket, and eventually, a 
satellite. To achieve this, I have been studying books, watching YouTube tutorials, and practicing diligently. I'm currently 
focused on learning about radio waves and transmitters, and I am not slowing down.


I mention all this to illustrate my curiosity and passion for learning new topics and taking on increasingly challenging 
projects. Besides these personal projects, my major goal right now is securing a job in the tech field, which has proven to be 
one of the biggest challenges I have faced. Since graduating, I have applied to 3-5 jobs daily and secured only five 
interviews without any offers. I believe a key reason for this is my lack of internship experience during college, primarily 
due to the impact of COVID-19.


Despite this, I am confident in my skills and eager to learn whatever is necessary to get the job done. This determination led
me to pursue a master’s degree, hoping to gain internship opportunities. I could have settled for a job outside of tech, but 
my love for the field drives me to take this gamble, hoping it pays off. Becoming an MLH Fellow is a crucial part of this 
journey, providing me with the experience and skill development I need to succeed in the tech industry.

**Question 2**
As a first-generation immigrant and college graduate, I bring a unique perspective shaped by resilience, hard work, and adaptability. I 
have always believed that hard work pays off, and I am committed to applying myself fully, regardless of the challenges I face.


In November 2021, I was diagnosed with tinnitus, which significantly impacted my ability to focus and study. Before this diagnosis, I 
was a high-achieving student, consistently earning mostly A's and a few B's. The onset of tinnitus marked one of the darkest periods of 
my life, affecting my mental health and causing my grades to slip. Despite these challenges, I have learned coping methods and 
strategies to manage my condition and continue my education.


This experience has taught me invaluable lessons about the fragility of life and the importance of perseverance. It has deepened my 
appreciation for the support of friends and family and reinforced my belief that things can and do get better with time and effort.


Initially, my goal was to become a doctor, but due to financial constraints and being new to America, I shifted my focus to Computer 
Science, where I discovered a new passion. My struggle with tinnitus has reignited my interest in the medical field, and I now aspire 
to integrate my knowledge of computer science with medical applications to improve people's lives. I am driven by the hope that even a 
small contribution can make a significant difference for someone in need.


By joining the MLH Fellowship, I aim to bring my determination, resilience, and interdisciplinary perspective to the community. I hope 
to contribute to the fellowship by sharing my experiences and learning from others, all while working towards innovations that bridge 
technology and medicine to create a positive impact.

My name is Arterio Rodrigues a recent graduate of Summer 23 in Computer Science. I have always been excited by the challenge of a new 
adventure, I love learning new things and firguring out the problems around it. That lead me to Computer Science when I started in2019. 
I hadn’t coded much before then but over my 4 year at Hunter I grew a love for the field. Taking time outside of school to build 
projects on github, pratice hundreds of leetcode problems and building computers froms 6502 processers and x86. Currently I am learning
about elctrical engineering from my sister dad which has open a hold new door of discovery. I recently bought an arduino and abuncn of 
differents parts. Like resistors, motors, survoa and so on to learn about integrating programming and robotics with the hopes of 
building a model submarine, airplain and rocket and hopefully one day in satilite in space. To make this a reality I have bought books 
about the topic watch youtubes and pratice. Learning about radio waves and transmitters is what I am currently focusing on and I am not
slowlying down. 

I say all that to give a small idea of my curiousity I love learning new topics and taking on harder and harder projects. Besides the 
projects I have just listed my major one currently is securing a job in the tech field. This is proving to be one of the biggest 
challenges I have ever faced. I have been apply every day to 3-5 jobs since I graduated and I have only secured 5 interviews with no 
offers. I beilve a key reason for this is because I didn’t complete an internship durig my time at college. This was due to many reason 
one major one begin I want to school during covid. I believe I have the skills and if I don’t I am 110% read to learn what I need to 
get the job done. This was my reason for entering colleg again and persuing my master degree, just to have an opertunity to get an 
internship. I could have settled and gotten a job outside of tech but I really love the field and want to be in it so I taking agamble 
and hopes it pays off. MLH is a key part of this gamble with being able to proved me with the experinece I need and develop my skill 
even futher. 

I am a first generation immigrant and college graduate. I have been taught hard works pays off and I have a very strong mindset on 
works and the ability to apply yourself. Yes, there are thing I probably can’t do but that won’t stop me form giving it the upmost best
try I could give it. In november 2021 I was dianogsed with Tinnitus and that caused my grades to slip I could no longer focus and study
for my classes. Before that I was the happiest person ever with no care in the world my grades where great mostly A’s and a few B’s. 
But I got tinnitus it was one of the most dark times in my life and had a lot of bad thoughts and I almost failed all my classes that 
semester and the semester following. Almost 3 years later it still hard for me to study but I have learn methods to coop and over come 
it. I learnt a lot during the past 3 year such as how much to appreciate life and how short it truly is and it can change in a second 
and most importantly things will get better. Luckly for me I had friends and family that could help me over come it. 


My orignal goal for join college was to be a doctor but due to finance reason and being a new immigrant to america my family could 

aford it I still found a love in computer science but after experince Tinnitus this had lead back on the path of medicine. I want to 
imcorporte what I learnt in computer science and apply toward the medical  industry to make people lives better. Everyone has something 
there are suffering with and if I could make one thing that will help only 1 person I would be enturnaly happy.
